    "- First apply the trained language model and compute the `perplexity` for the `unigram \"america\"`. Compare if the perplexity is really the inverse probability which has been calculated before via `model.score`. Moreover take the sentence `<s> <s> make america great again </s> </s>` and convert all the bigrams within a list `[('<s>', '<s>'), ('<s>', 'make'), ...]`, which is then used as input for the `perplexity` computation. \n",
    "- Second, use the trained language model together with your `validation set` and compute the `perplexity` for each sentence in the validation set using the `everygram` output (compute total perplexity and averaged across all sentences)\n",
    "- In case the performance is not very promising and/or you are observing a lot of `inf` values (division by zero in the perplexity equation) try to have a look at your pipeline and try to further optimize the text preprocessing and parametric setup (reduce the complexity of the vocabualry, e.g. increase `unk_cutoff`, use categorical approaches (e.g. `NER`), change the size of `N`, use a LM with an integrated smoothing concept (e.g. `Laplace`, etc.), besides looking for any other strange behaviors\n",
    "- Once the performance on the validation corpus is satisfying, verify your model also on the final and unseen `test set` (via `perplexity` and same approach) - Large deviations?"
